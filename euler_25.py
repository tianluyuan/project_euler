"""
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

   Hence the first 12 terms will be:

     F[1] = 1
     F[2] = 1
     F[3] = 2
     F[4] = 3
     F[5] = 5
     F[6] = 8
     F[7] = 13
     F[8] = 21
     F[9] = 34
     F[10] = 55
     F[11] = 89
     F[12] = 144

   The 12th term, F[12], is the first term to contain three digits.

   What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
